# Maths-Grapher-tool

This project is build to plot graphs of mathematical functions

please note that you need numpy and matplotlib installed in your computer before executing the codes...

If you like this code kindly notify me in github and please suggest recomendations if any...

This code was bulit by me as a part of learning python .. i am just a 17 year old making these projects for fun .. so don't get angry in case of any stupid lines of code written by me...lol


good news the 3d grapher code supports use 'pi' that is 3.1415.... you can type pi in place of 22/7 in the input area...
eg: " 22/7 + 3 " can also be written as " pi +3 "



both the codes support usage of 'e'
that is ..
1)  "2e11" is as same as '2 x (10^11)'
2)  " 2 + e " is as same as " 2 + 2.71828 "
